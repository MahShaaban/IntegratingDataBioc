Description: Researchers use ChIP binding data to identify potential 
    transcription factor binding sites. They use gene expression data from 
    sequencing or microarrays to quantify the effect of the factor 
    overexpression or knockdown on its targets. The integration of the binding 
    and expression data therefore can be used to improve the understanding of a 
    transcription factor function. In this workshop, we present a complete 
    workflow for integrating the gene expression (RNA-seq) and DNA-binding data 
    (ChIP-seq) to predict the combined function of two transcription factors 
    using R/Bioconductor. The example we will be using in the workshop is from 
    real datasets of two functionally and evolutionary related transcription 
    factors YY1 and YY2 in HeLa cells. We will try to identify the 
    factor-specific and the shared targets of the factors in this particular 
    cell line. Then we will use a technique find out the aggregate functions of 
    the factors on their individual (inducer or repressor) and common targets
    (cooperative or competitive). The first half of the workshop would be 
    dedicated to introduce the target package followed by a walk through the 
    workflow interactively in a live demo in the second half.
