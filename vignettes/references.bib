abstract = {Yin Yang 1 (YY1) is a critical transcription factor controlling cell proliferation, development and DNA damage responses. Retrotranspositions have independently generated additional YY family members in multiple species. Although Drosophila YY1 [pleiohomeotic (Pho)] and its homolog [pleiohomeotic-like (Phol)] redundantly control homeotic gene expression, the regulatory contributions of YY1-homologs have not yet been examined in other species. Indeed, targets for the mammalian YY1 homolog YY2 are completely unknown. Using gene set enrichment analysis, we found that lentiviral constructs containing short hairpin loop inhibitory RNAs for human YY1 (shYY1) and its homolog YY2 (shYY2) caused significant changes in both shared and distinguishable gene sets in human cells. Ribosomal protein genes were the most significant gene set upregulated by both shYY1 and shYY2, although combined shYY1/2 knock downs were not additive. In contrast, shYY2 reversed the anti-proliferative effects of shYY1, and shYY2 particularly altered UV damage response, platelet-specific and mitochondrial function genes. We found that decreases in YY1 or YY2 caused inverse changes in UV sensitivity, and that their combined loss reversed their respective individual effects. Our studies show that human YY2 is not redundant to YY1, and YY2 is a significant regulator of genes previously identified as uniquely responding to YY1. {\textcopyright} The Author(s) 2010.

abstract = {In human transcriptional regulation, DNA-sequence-specific factors can associate with intermediaries that orchestrate interactions with a diverse set of chromatin-modifying enzymes. One such intermediary is HCFC1 (also known as HCF-1). HCFC1, first identified in herpes simplex virus transcription, has a poorly defined role in cellular transcriptional regulation. We show here that, in HeLa cells, HCFC1 is observed bound to 5400 generally active CpG-island promoters. Examination of the DNA sequences underlying the HCFC1-binding sites revealed three sequence motifs associated with the binding of (1) ZNF143 and THAP11 (also known as Ronin), (2) GABP, and (3) YY1 sequence-specific transcription factors. Subsequent analysis revealed colocalization of HCFC1 with these four transcription factors at âˆ¼90{\%} of the 5400 HCFC1-bound promoters. These studies suggest that a relatively small number of transcription factors play a major role in HeLa-cell transcriptional regulation in association with HCFC1.},

@article{Wu2017d,
abstract = {Yin Yang 1 (YY1) is a multifunctional DNA-binding transcription factor shown to be critical in a variety of biological processes, and its activity and function have been shown to be regulated by multitude of mechanisms, which include but are not limited to post-translational modifications (PTMs), its associated proteins and cellular localization. YY2, the paralog of YY1 in mouse and human, has been proposed to function redundantly or oppositely in a context-specific manner compared with YY1. Despite its functional importance, how YY2's DNA-binding activity and function are regulated, particularly by PTMs, remains completely unknown. Here we report the first PTM with functional characterization on YY2, namely lysine 247 monomethylation (K247me1), which was found to be dynamically regulated by SET7/9 and LSD1 both in vitro and in cultured cells. Functional study revealed that SET7/9-mediated YY2 methylation regulated its DNA-binding activity in vitro and in association with chromatin examined by chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with sequencing (ChIP-seq) in cultured cells. Knockout of YY2, SET7/9 or LSD1 by CRISPR (clustered, regularly interspaced, short palindromic repeats)/Cas9-mediated gene editing followed by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) revealed that a subset of genes was positively regulated by YY2 and SET7/9, but negatively regulated by LSD1, which were enriched with genes involved in cell proliferation regulation. Importantly, YY2-regulated gene transcription, cell proliferation and tumor growth were dependent, at least partially, on YY2 K247 methylation. Finally, somatic mutations on YY2 found in cancer, which are in close proximity to K247, altered its methylation, DNA-binding activity and gene transcription it controls. Our findings revealed the first PTM with functional implications imposed on YY2 protein, and linked YY2 methylation with its biological functions.},
